        <h2>My Truth</h2>
        <p><strong>By Gracetacular23 | July 10, 2019</strong></p>
        
        <article>
<p>Jun, Angel, and I weren’t close siblings when we were young. We lived in a harsh household, overshadowed by the ever-present storm of our father’s temper. It was difficult to have fun unless we were outside. Jun, my big brother, was the one who asked the most questions—too many, in fact. Many of them only seemed to make our father angrier. Every night, it felt like our dad was on the verge of exploding with rage and frustration, making it nearly impossible to open up about our day.</p>

<p>Still, he was our father. To Jun, though, he was the harshest, setting impossible expectations for his only son—the one who was supposed to carry on his legacy. I should have noticed the moment Jun started to break. Although he still did well in school and came home every afternoon, he grew quieter, more withdrawn. He spent most of his time in his room, playing his guitar as softly as possible. Even so, there were moments when he would join Angel and me, especially when our parents were having one of their bad days.</p>

<p>Then, one night, everything changed. Our father found drugs. The shouting echoed through the house, waking us from our rooms. I ran downstairs only to see Jun standing there, facing our father’s fury. Before I could react, my brother was thrown out of the house. I stood frozen as my mother pleaded with our father to bring him back, and Angel sobbed for our brother. But I did nothing. I just stood there, a coward. It’s a moment I regret every single night.</p>

<p>Weeks later, we heard that Jun was staying with our titas, but our father refused to let us visit him. Three years passed. Then, one day, I found him.</p>

<p>I had just left my best friend’s house, walking my usual route home, when I saw him. He was thinner, his face covered in facial hair, and tattoos decorated his skin. Though only three years had passed, he looked like he had aged a decade. Fear crept into my heart—had he really become the person our father claimed he was? But then, he looked at me and smiled. That was my brother.</p>

<p>I ran to him and hugged him tightly, unwilling to let him go again. But this time, I didn’t have to. We started meeting up from time to time. He told me about the work he was doing—fighting against the corruption in our government. He had a social media account dedicated to exposing the horrors of our president’s drug war—the same drug war our father so firmly believed in. Sometimes, I brought Angel with me, and in those moments, it felt like we were a family again.</p>

<p>But happiness doesn’t last forever.</p>

<p>On June 10, 2019, my brother died. And I was alone.</p>

<p>We weren’t allowed to grieve. Our father refused to acknowledge him, ashamed and enraged. Even mentioning Jun’s name was enough to send him into a fury. There was no funeral, no memorial—nothing to honor his life. The injustice of it all burned inside me.</p>

<p>So I continued his work. I took over his account and posted every day. I never stopped.</p>

<p>Eventually, I reached out to our cousin, Jay. He and Jun had been penpals for years, though we hadn’t seen each other in a long time. I messaged him anonymously, telling him about Jun’s death—the injustice, the horror of it all. A week later, Jay flew to the Philippines. He cared more than I expected.</p>

<p>I soon learned that he was investigating the truth behind Jun’s death. That gave me hope—hope that my brother would get the justice he deserved. When Jay discovered that I was the one who had reached out to him, we finally talked. I didn’t trust him at first, but over time, I did.</p>

<p>His investigation uncovered something I never expected. He met someone who had lived with Jun for two years—someone who swore Jun never did drugs. I was relieved.</p>

<p>Then came the day of reckoning. Our entire family gathered at our Lolo and Lola’s house. Jay and I decided it was time to confront my father. He told us that our Tito Danilo knew the truth—that it would hurt us and that, in the end, we would realize he was right. At the time, I didn’t understand what he meant. I just wanted the truth.</p>

<p>But I should have known it wouldn’t be kind.</p>

<p>Jay and I went to Tito Danilo’s church and asked. The truth was brutal: Jun had done drugs. Worse, he had been a drug pusher. He was killed by a vigilante hired to execute people like him.</p>

<p>I was heartbroken. I wanted to scream, to cry, to demand an explanation. But I also knew something undeniable: we are all human. We all make mistakes. And Jun—he wasn’t a hero, nor was he a villain. He was human.</p>

<p>I learned to accept that.</p>

<p>But I will never forget his kindness, his compassion, and how deeply he cared for others. That is the part of him I will carry with me for the rest of my life.</p>
